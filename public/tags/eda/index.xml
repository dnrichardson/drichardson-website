      <description>Description Over the past year I have spent a good portion of time in the office studying and preparing for a career transition. Finding a suitable work-life balance has been difficult, especially with the clock ticking on my post-doctoral fellowship running out in December, 2017. Most free moments I have during the day are usually d towards studying something datascience related or doing some sports in an effort to keep mind and body balanced.</description>
