      <description>Description Over the past year I have spent a good portion of time in the office studying and preparing for a career transition. Finding a suitable work-life balance has been difficult, especially with the clock ticking on my post-doctoral fellowship running out in December, 2017. Most free moments I have during the day are usually d towards studying something datascience related or doing some sports in an effort to keep mind and body balanced.</description>

      <description>Dale Richardson, PhD I am a bioinformatics analyst of large scale genomics data and aspiring data scientist with an intense dedication to continued learning.
Scientific research interests Post-transcriptional gene regulation, alternative splicing, comparative genomics, abiotic stress response
Currently I conduct research on alternative splicing and abiotic stress responses in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. In my spare time, I take online courses in preparation for a career transition into data analysis/data science.</description>

      <description>Currently I&amp;rsquo;m a postdoc in the Plant Molecular Biology Laboratory at the Instituto Gulbenkian de CiÃªncia (IGC), a research institution located just outside of Lisbon, Portugal. I primarily rely on R and a suite of bioinformatics tools to analyze large-scale genomic changes in response to abiotic stress in the model plant organism, Arabidopsis thaliana, commonly known as the &amp;ldquo;thale cress&amp;rdquo;.
In transition Although I hold a special place in my heart for research science, it has become abundantly clear to me that I need to move into a new challenge.</description>
