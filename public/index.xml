      <description>Dale Richardson, PhD I am a bioinformatics analyst of large scale genomics data and aspiring data scientist with an intense dedication to continued learning.
Scientific research interests Post-transcriptional gene regulation, alternative splicing, comparative genomics, abiotic stress response
Currently I conduct research on alternative splicing and abiotic stress responses in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. In my spare time, I take online courses in preparation for a career transition into data analysis/data science.</description>

      <description>Currently I&amp;rsquo;m a postdoc in the Plant Molecular Biology Laboratory at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC), a research institution located just outside of Lisbon, Portugal. I primarily rely on R and a suite of bioinformatics tools to analyze large-scale genomic changes in response to abiotic stress in the model plant organism, Arabidopsis thaliana, commonly known as the &amp;ldquo;thale cress&amp;rdquo;.
In transition Although I hold a special place in my heart for research science, it has become abundantly clear to me that I need to move into a new challenge.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo Goto hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your os and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at installing hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
 Clone the hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313  Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
