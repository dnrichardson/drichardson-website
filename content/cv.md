## Dale Richardson, PhD

I am a bioinformatics analyst of large scale genomics data and aspiring data scientist with an intense dedication to continued learning.

### Scientific research interests
Post-transcriptional gene regulation, alternative splicing, comparative genomics, abiotic stress response

## Currently
I conduct research on alternative splicing and abiotic stress responses in the model plant, *Arabidopsis thaliana*. In my spare time, I take online courses in preparation for a career transition into data analysis/data science.

### Specialized in
- Next Generation RNASeq data analysis
- Data analysis and statistics with R
- Plant Molecular Biology 
- Quantitative Real Time PCR

### Would like to be specialized in
- Python programming
- SQL
- Machine Learning / Predictive Analytics
