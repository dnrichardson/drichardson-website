## A work in progress
This site is a work in progress! I'm working hard to find the time to make updates to the site and build up a portfolio of analyses. Expect more projects and posts soon :).

## Currently

I'm a postdoc in the [Plant Molecular Biology Laboratory](http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/pduque) at the [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC)](http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt), a research institution located just outside of Lisbon, Portugal. I primarily rely on `R` and a suite of bioinformatics tools to analyze large-scale genomic changes in response to abiotic stress in the model plant organism, [*Arabidopsis thaliana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana), commonly known as the "thale cress".

## In transition

Although I hold a special place in my heart for research science, it has become abundantly clear to me that I need to move into a new challenge. 

I believe it is important to be engaged in something that one truly loves doing, where motivation arises without force and passion drives you effortlessly. 

In late 2016, I learned about the fields of `data anayltics` and `data science` and quickly became intrigued and then impassioned. I started to listen to all sorts of data science podcasts, sign up for online courses, browse bootcamp options and just basically immerse myself in the subject as much as possible. 

I quickly realized that this was not going to be an overnight endeavor but instead was going to be an extended, uphill journey fraught with challenges (internal and external). 

However, I believe it is only by facing our challenges that we truly grow personally and professionally. 

And so I find myself here, creating this space as a chronicle of my journey from research science to data science. 

###### Ultimately, my goal is to shift out of my role as a postdoc and pivot to a role as a data analyst/scientist in early 2018.
